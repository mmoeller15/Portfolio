# Portfolio

### 1. Personal Website
   
https://github.com/mmoeller15/DIMA358WebDesignWebsite \
Every DIMA 358 Web Design assignment was uploaded to this website. 

The midterm portfolio is a personal website complete with resume and project pages. It was created to resemble 8-bit video games and/or a terminal.

The final project, focuses on sustainability with my topic being Community Gardens. Beyond being a source of information, the website also uses the Trefle API to provide users plant recommendations for creating their own community gardens based on zone, light, conditions, etc.

### 2. Microbialite Database Website 
https://github.com/mmoeller15/Microbialite-Website \
This website was a semester-long group project created for CISC 450 Database Design in collaboration with Dr. Hickson, a geology professor at the University of St. Thomas. The database was a vast, unorganized, collection of data gathered by Dr. Hickson and his team to study formations of Microbialites in Nevada. It was our job to normalize the data and create a user interface with which the data could be accessed by other researchers and where more data could be add or deleted. The website was designed to interact with the Microbialite Database. The user interface uses JavaScript. Node.js was used to create an API connecting the website to the sqlite3 database. Users are able to view, add, and delete data from the database. 

### 3. 3D Projections
https://github.com/mmoeller15/cg-3dprojections \
Using HTML's Canvas 2D API, implements 3D line drawing by projecting models onto the view-plane.  
   
### 4. Fragment Shaders
https://github.com/mmoeller15/cg-fragmentshaders \
Manipulated textures with our fragment shader to create some cool effects! Used GLSL via Babylon's WebGL2 API.
